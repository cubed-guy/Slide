# Slide

The popular and nostalgic; slide the number into order, puzzle implementation using python on pygame module, which I made as my 1st sem project.
Slide is a very enticing game that not only boosts the user's logical and mathematical skills but also provides endless entertainment. Open to all ages. You can relive your childhood by playing the game and getting lost in nostalgia. 

## How does a slide puzzle work?!

Most sliding puzzles are two-dimensional. The pieces cannot be lifted out of the frame or rearranged in any way, except by sliding them into an empty space. They are also called sliding-block puzzles or simply sliders. The goal of a sliding puzzle is to arrange the pieces in a particular pattern.
Have fun :)
